Here are somthing that I have learned for variables and data-types
- In python there are many built in fuction and python is case-sensitive.
- Built in functions are globally available for your use that mean you can make use of the buil in fuction without importing or congiguring.
- Some of them are : int(), print(), float(), str(), min() and so on.
- Example: min(20,230,70) #20
           sum([20,30]) #50
- Variable store data in the computer memory. Mnemonic variable are recommended to use in many programming language that can be easily remembered and associated.

# Python variable name rules
- A variable name must start with _ or a letter. 
 - E.g., first_name, _name, and so on.
- A variable cannot start with a number.
 - E.g., 1first, 2_name, and so on.
- Variable name are case sensitive.
 - E.g., first_name and First_name are two different variables.

# Casting
- Converting one data type in to another data type.
- We use int(), float(), str() and so on.
Example: COnvert int into float
 -- first_number = 10
    print('Integer', first_number) #10
    changed_float = float(first_number) 
    print('Float Value', changed_float) #10.0
